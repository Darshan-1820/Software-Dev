# NotebookLM Workflow (Beginner)

Goal: Use NotebookLM to explain your own code in simple language.

## What to Upload
- A single file at a time (start small)
- Example: `assure-backend-live/models/UserCard.js`

## Best Prompts
- "Explain this file like I am 5"
- "Summarize the main purpose in 5 bullets"
- "List confusing parts and why they matter"
- "Show me the data flow from input to output"

## Save Back to Obsidian
After each session, save:
- 3 key ideas you learned
- 1 confusing point
- 1 question for next time

## Good First Targets
- `assure-frontend-live/src/App.jsx` (prototype)
- `assure-backend-live/index.js`
- `Assure_Mobile-production/.../EmvCommandHandler.java`
