## How Developers Plan

- Write a small test plan (how you will check it worked)

## How Developers Learn a New Codebase
- Find the entry point (main file)
- Trace one request end-to-end
- Draw a small diagram (boxes and arrows)

## How Developers Debug
- Reproduce the problem

- Fix the smallest possible thing
- Re-test and confirm
