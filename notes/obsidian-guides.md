# Obsidian Workflow (Beginner)

Goal: Keep learning notes clear, searchable, and linked to your real code.

## Simple Folder Setup
- Vault root: `Software-Dev`
- Use these folders:
  - `learning/` for lessons
  - `plan/` for feature plans
  - `notes/` for tool guides and habits

## Daily Note Template
Title: `YYYY-MM-DD`

Sections:
- What I learned
- What I changed
- Questions for next time

## Note Template (Use Everywhere)
- What is it?
- Why is it important?
- Where is it in my code?
- Small example
- My questions

## Linking Notes
- Use wiki links: `[[01-javascript-fundamentals]]`
- Link to files by path: `assure-backend-live/models/UserCard.js`

## Tags (Keep it minimal)
- `#concept`
- `#code`
- `#bug`
- `#practice`

## Best Practice
- One idea per note
- Short sentences
- Add at least one question you can research later
